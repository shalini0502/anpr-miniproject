# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

## Overview
This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system built using Python, OpenCV, and Pytesseract. The system is designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or video feeds, achieving a high recognition accuracy rate of over 95%. This project has applications in traffic monitoring, security, and automated toll systems.

## Features
- **License Plate Detection**: Uses image processing techniques to locate and crop number plates from vehicle images.
- **Character Recognition**: Utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Pytesseract to interpret text on license plates.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a recognition rate of over 95%, even with varying image quality and lighting conditions.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Capable of processing real-time video feeds for dynamic vehicle tracking and recognition.
